# CSIS3280-Final-Project
-Description:
For this project, we have created a web application to host a movie database - Movie Hunter. Once logged in, users are allowed to search and lookup movies. They can make custom searches by year and title. They can add movies to their wishlist, or “watch” movies, that is, add it to their “watched” list, both of which are editable - not feeling a movie anymore? Remove it from your list! Our homepage also has a selection of movies grouped by latest trailers, or most rated for those users who are clueless about what to watch! Users also have the ability to change their account details, and delete it if they wish to part ways. On their account, users are provided with statistics about their movie watching habits. We have used the OMDB API for help with this website. Search results by the user are processed using this web service. 

-What I learnt:
Collaborating with group members to build a fully functional website - pair programming. Displaying statistics on websites, using external APIs.

-My contribution:
1. Setting up class structures for the three entities, database, PDO agent and DAO classes.
2. Working DAO classes, project documentation.
3. Setting up  MyAccount, About, WatchedMovies and MyMovies page i.e page contents and functionality using template.
